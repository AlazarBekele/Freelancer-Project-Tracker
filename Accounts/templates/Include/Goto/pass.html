                    <strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>

                    Freelancer Project Tracker (FPT) is a streamlined system designed to help freelancers and clients collaborate with clarity, speed, and confidence. By organizing projects into clear stages, FPT ensures that both parties understand expectations, timelines, and responsibilities from the very beginning.<br><br>

                    <strong>2. Project Transparency</strong><br>

                    With FPT, every task is clearly defined and documented, eliminating confusion and miscommunication. Both freelancer and client can easily track progress, view updates, and understand what has been completed and what work remains. This creates a smooth workflow and builds trust throughout the project.

                    <strong>3. Communication & Workflow</strong> <br>

                    FPT encourages healthy communication by organizing all discussions, revisions, and requests into well-structured sections. This makes it easy for clients to provide feedback and for freelancers to respond efficiently. No information gets lost, and every step of the project is traceable.

                    <strong>4. Revision & Approval Process</strong><br>

                    To maintain project quality, FPT uses a step-by-step revision system. Each stage must be reviewed and approved by the client before moving forward. This ensures that the final result meets expectations and reduces time spent on unnecessary corrections or misunderstandings.

                    <strong>5. Payment & Timeline Accountability</strong><br>

                    Freelancer Project Tracker provides a clear breakdown of the project cost, payment schedule, and deadlines. Clients always know what they are paying for, and freelancers are protected by documented milestones. FPT brings fairness and transparency to the financial side of the project.
